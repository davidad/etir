================================================================================

          The surface of the Earth
            is the shore of the cosmic ocean
          Recently we've waded a little way out
            and the water seems inviting

Humanity is presently a one-planet species. Although we have sent humans into
space, and even to the moon, they have only visited and then returned home to
Earth. There are three ways in which this limits us: First, it limits the
amount of real estate available for human life and activity to that of this
planet. Second, it limits the resources available to us, both in terms of
matter and energy. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it makes us 
vulnerable to total destruction as a species, should a catastrophe of planetary
scale occur.

This report focuses on short-term steps that may facilitate the eventual 
establishment of a permanent human presence in space. These steps include the
development of technologies to reduce the barriers to entry into space,
technologies that may be needed to remain in space indefinitely, and means to
educate, excite, and inspire the general public about the possibilites and
importance of human space exploration.

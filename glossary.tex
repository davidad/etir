%%GLOSSARY
\newacronymd{CLLSS}{Closed-Loop Life Support Systems}{are life support systems which reuse 100\% of their waste resources, with the exception of waste energy}
\newacronymd{COSPAR}{Committee on Space Research}{COSPAR promotes international scientific research in space, and provides an open forum for the disucssion of problems related to space science (for instance, organizing conferences on planetary protection policy).}
\newacronym{LEO}{LEO}{Low Earth Orbit}
\newacronymd{SSTO}{Single Stage to Orbit}{refers to a vehicle which reaches orbit without jettisoning hardware, expending only fluids. The term usually, but not exclusively, refers to reusable vehicles. \nopostdesc}
\newacronymd{ITAR}{International Traffic in Arms Regulations}{a set of United States federal regulations that restrict the international trade of items and information which is considered by the federal government to be ``munitions,'' including encryption technology and space technology}
\newacronym{ISS}{ISS}{International Space Station}
\newacronymd{ISRU}{In-Situ Resource Utilization}{refers to the usage of local resources, especially the local usage of resources found in space, as opposed to the transport of Earth resources into space or vice versa. \nopostdesc}
\newacronym{SLS}{SLS}{Selective Laser Sintering}
\newacronym{EBFF}{EBFF}{Electron Beam Freeform Fabrication}

\newglossaryentry{Isp}{text={\isp}, name={specific impulse (\isp)}, first={specific impulse (\isp)}, description={is a metric of rocket (or jet) efficiency; the change in momentum per unit amount of propellant used. (This works out to an SI unit of seconds.) The higher the specific impulse, the less propellant is needed to gain a given amount of momentum. For example, the Space Shuttle Main Engine has an \isp of 453s. \nopostdesc}}
\newglossaryentry{gyrotron}{text={gyrotron}, name={gyrotron}, description={a type of high-powered microwave transmitter}}

\newglossaryentry{payload-fraction}{name={payload fraction},description={the fraction of a launch
vehicle's mass on the launchpad which is allocated to the object(s) being
launched (payload), rather than structural materials, fuel, etc. \nopostdesc}}

\newglossaryentry{rocket-equation}{name={ideal rocket equation},description={an equation which relates
the maximum change of speed of a rocket with the \isp and the initial and final mass of the rocket.
\[\Delta v = I_{\rm sp} g_0 \ln \frac{m_0}{m_1}\] where $m_0$ is the initial total mass, including
propellant; $m_1$ is the final total mass, \isp is the specific impulse of the engine, $g_0$ is the
initial acceleration due to gravity, and $\Delta v$ is the change of speed of the rocket over the
entire period}}

\newacronymd{fMRI}{functional  Magnetic Resonance Imaging}{a technology for measuring brain  activity which is well-known and widely used, but with low spatial  resolution}
\newacronymd{PET}{Positron Emission Tomography}{an older technology for measuring brain activity}

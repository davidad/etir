Humanity is presently a one-planet species. Although we have sent
humans into space, and even to the moon, they have only visited and
then returned home to Earth. There are two ways in which this
fundamentally limits us: First, it limits the resources available to
us, in terms of both matter and energy. Second, it makes us vulnerable
to total destruction as a species, should a catastrophe of planetary
scale occur.

This report focuses on applications of exponential technologies that may
facilitate the eventual establishment of a permanent human presence in space.
These steps include the development of technologies to reduce the barriers to
entry into space, technologies that may be needed to remain in space
indefinitely (while also being useful on Earth), practical strategies to use
resources which are off Earth, transformative changes in the business of space
science and exploration, and means to educate, excite, and inspire the general
public about the possibilities and importance of human space exploration.

\section{Aspects of the Problem Space}
\label{problem-spaces}
% Short description of the entire Problem Space
% FIX FIX FIX
Doing business in space should be easy, but it isn't. It's hard to get into
space, even sending robots rather than humans. It's hard to stay in space for
very long--again, even if you send robots.  It's hard to make use of the
resources available in space. And it's hard to convince many people that going
to space is even a good idea.
% TODO?

We have chosen to focus on the following aspects of the problem space:
%Detailed description of aspects of the problem space

\subsection{Insuring Humanity}
\label{ps-insuring-humanity}
%(to be  written by davidad)

\subsection{Getting There}
\label{ps-getting-there}
%(to be written by Dmitriy)

The key problem driving the cost of space access today is fundamental
inefficiency of chemical rockets. In the year 2010 payloads are delivered into
orbit the same way they were launched in 1960s: by exploding large amounts of
chemicals in a semi-controlled way. Conventional multistage rockets are limited
to \glspl{payload-fraction} of less than 4\%. Using the \gls{rocket-equation},
it is easy to see that this inefficiency is caused partly by the structural
limits of existing materials, and partly by the limited \gls{Isp} of chemical
propellants, which have reached a practical limit of 453 seconds. 
 
Inefficiency of chemical propulsion results in unreasonable complexity of
present day launch vehicles, which operate on the very limits of structural
margins. This requires a large number of people to work on the maintenance,
operation and pre-flight checks.  It also prevents reusability of rockets,
leading to unacceptably high risks associated with launch and extremely high
costs of payload insurance. Launch of a chemical rocket is a violent process
and a structure operating near its design tolerance is more susceptible to
fatigue and failure. The Space Shuttle, as a reusable vehicle, requires
extensive refurbishment and safety checks between launches, to the extent that
the launcher is disassembled, inspected, refurbished and rebuilt before every
launch. For example, a hydrogen tank used for the on-board fuel cell is
manufactured to burst at 1.5 times its usual operating pressure in order to
save mass, but this safety factor of 1.5 means the tank may last only 100
cycles. Such a failure-prone component must have a more regular inspection
regime, so operational costs go up. In contrast, the fuselage of a pressurized
civil aircraft has a safety factor of two, and for that relatively little extra
mass will last tens of thousands of pressurization cycles. 
 
The high cost of space launch arises not only from technical challenges but
also from the absence of economic incentives and the lack of a well defined
market.  Although, we would argue, those economical challenges will be
eliminated as soon as the technical challenges of building cheap and reliable
launch vehicles are resolved. On the economic side, various market models
predict an essentially flat elasticity of demand for space access until the
cost of launch is reduced below \$1000 per kilogram\cite{CommSpace1997}. (See
\autoref{launch-cost}.) This implies that the primary economic benefits of space
cannot be realized without an order of magnitude reduction in launch costs and
hence, without a paradigm shift in the means of space launch systems. 
 
\begin{figure}[bt!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{launch-cost}
	\caption{Cost of space access over the last 5 decades}
	\label{launch-cost}
\end{figure}

An additional problem that is deeply rooted in the inefficiency of chemical
rockets and the absence of mature space exploration market is lack of mass
produced cheap components for space launch systems. All critical components are
custom produced and tested by large teams over long periods of time. This leads
into yet another problem: the time lags between the payload production and
launch are unacceptably long and can hardly fit into business models of small-
and medium-sized businesses which demand expediency as they are driven by the
demand of rapid growth. Moreover, the current way of space transportation often
requires high level of integration between the launch vehicle and the payload,
which means that the customer is forced to choose the supplier long in advance
and coordinate the development of payload with the launch provider. 

In summary, launch is currently almost prohibitively expensive, infrequent, and
inconvenient. Any transformative change in the landscape of space activity will
require more effective launch systems.

\subsection{Staying There \label{staying-there}}
\label{ps-staying-there}

The conditions we have to create in space for human life to thrive are to some
extent the same humans need to create in order to stay on Earth. As we need to
create conditions on Earth which are conducive to life, so have we in space.
However, between the two environments there are some fundamental differences.
In space the key challenges derive from: lack of breathable air/atmosphere;
lack of all other life support systems, services, and goods/materials provided
on Earth by Nature, as well as extreme temperatures; radiation; absence of or
reduced gravity; different light-dark patterns; reduced number of people, at
least in the early stages of space colonization, isolation, and reduced
availability of physical space.
 
A space system inhabitable by humans, at least given present technologies,
should be designed in order to become, at a certain point, closed for matter
and open for energy. All the living parts and beings would be interconnected
and interdependent, as well as diverse and symbiotic.
 
Staying in a space environment, either grounded or ungrounded, requires the
respect of three fundamental principles: 

\begin{enumerate}

	\item     People in the space environment should not be subject to increasing
		concentrations of substances produced by human activity, such as molecules
		or chemical substances which if not removed would accumulate in air, soil,
		water, or other materials (for example CO$_2$, CH$_4$, other chemical
		substances).

	\item     In a thriving space environment the fundamental life support
		systems should be recreated and operated in a reliable way, indefinitely in
		time. Through photosynthesis, or other processes achieving a similar
		result, the space life-support systems should be able to regenerate order
		and structure for human use, starting from higher levels of disorder, using
		external energy sources.

 \item     In space settlements people should not subject to conditions that
	 systematically compromise their capacity to satisfy their fundamental human
	 needs. Human needs can be classified in nine categories, in four domains---%
	 Being (qualities), Having (things),  Doing (actions), Interacting (settings)%
	 ---and all should be satisfied for a healthy and thriving life:

If humans in space should be deprived of the capacity to satisfy any of the
needs above, in a sufficiently abrupt manner or for a sufficiently long time
duration, they would face a mental and/or physical poverty at first, and
eventually, if the deprivation persists, they could be led to death. Any
relational or governance system established in a space environment, especially
with the goal of ``staying there,'' should consider all the fundamental human
needs above. It should be noticed that while the satisfiers of the needs change
across cultures, or time, the needs themselves remain constant. For this
reason, a space environment and space activities should be designed to maximize
the satisfaction of the human needs without violating the previous principles.
This result can often be conveniently achieved through dematerialization, which
becomes more and more effective with the advancement of exponential
technologies such as augmented virtual reality. The fundamental design
principles for human interaction in space could be the ``Golden Rule'': ``Would
I like to be subject to such conditions I am creating?''

Once the design principles above have been considered, the challenge remains
how to implement them in the extreme space environment.

\subsection{Human Exploration}
\label{ps-human-exploration}
%(to be written by Sarah Jane)

%emailed

Human exploration beyond Earth's atmosphere presents many threats and promises
to meeting basic human needs: The conditions are inhospitable to human life.
There is no known air source. The temperatures are extreme. Radiation is
intense. Meteor showers, solar flares, debris and dust are ever-present
threats. Human--rated infrastructures and outposts do not exist. Other forms of
life have yet to be found.  The challenges associated with understanding and
preparing for optimum general human wellbeing in space is multitudinous. The
recommendation, risk assessment and mitigation (be it technology,
countermeasure development or advanced life supports and protocols) for the
enhanced well being, performance, operation and happiness of the crews is
imperative.

\subsubsection*{Closed Loop Life Support Systems (CLLSS)}

The CLLSS components, resources and technologies needed to provide a basic foundation for a live-able, controllable and recoverable environment for human space flight and habitability must include the following space-rated systems:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Atmospheric Revitalization

	\item  Water Recovery

  \item Waste Management

  \item Habitation System

  \item Environmental Monitoring

  \item Pressure Control

  \item Fire Protection

  \item Thermal Control

\end{itemize}

NASA's ECLASS can only achieve a 65\% closed loop effectiveness with current
systems technology (\autoref{eclss65}). This is acceptable for short duration
human space flight and life onboard the \gls{ISS}, but it does not suffice for
further human exploration.

	\caption{ECLSS Loop Closure: ISS 2010 + CH$_4$ Post-Process (kg pp/py) = 65\% effectiveness \cite{Neumeyer2010}}
	\label{eclss65}
\end{figure}

\begin{description}
\item[Food:] Need for a way to generate a complete, well rounded diet with minimal
input and output, 100\% closed loop if possible.  Bonus: enjoyable to eat.

\item[Water:] Need: Sophisticated waste and grey water systems to allow for closed loop water systems.

\item[Waste:] Design waste out of the system. Design and engineer systems able to operate completely in loops closed for matter and open for energy.

\item[Air:] Assure fully recyclable air systems able to work indefinitely at 100\% reliability.
\end{description}

Reliable fully closed loop life support systems for humans (\autoref{eclss95})
need to be demonstrated in ground test facilities and in space with increased
performance efficiencies such that little-to-no-maintenance, re-supply and the
capacity for bio-regeneration is incorporated into the design metrics towards
future autonomous space system adaptation and in situ resource utilization. We
must advance, demonstrate, and integrate current space rated hardware with new
technologies and strategies to also reduce the mass, power and re-supply
requirements when measured against the current state of the art space flight
qualified hardware and work towards both the issues of human survivability and
longevity whilst in space.

\subsubsection*{Human Factors}

Extreme environment architectures and habitat design greatly impact human
performance, behaviors and limits in everyday life as equally as instances of
great stress. As we know it, life in the space environment presents many
challenging factors for the crew including: conditions of prolonged
confinement, isolation, information saturation, performance pressure, constant
monitoring, time delays, unnatural lighting, limited color palette and seasonal
change, limited personal space, restricted access, thermal difference, the
reliance on reconstituted air, water, tactile starvation and increasing
physical acclimation as a result of radiation and microgravity. Reliability and
diversity are equal yet opposite needs for optimum human habitat design in
extreme environments.

\subsubsection*{Extreme Design}

Human-rated structures and habitable architectures for use in extreme
environments such as space must satisfy very unique requirements. Temperature
extremes, gravity, shielding from solar and cosmic radiation and
micro-meteoroid impacts, vacuum / internal pressurization, abrasive and toxic
materials such as planetary dust must be factored into design requirements.
These issues pose great challenges to the structural adequacy, materials
science and maintenance, compatibility, functionality, access and cost of
suitable architectures and structures.

 
\subsubsection*{Physiological Health}

Physiological acclimation in space flight is complex and diverse involving
multiple systems (\autoref{acc-timeline}). Past, present and future
countermeasures in space flight require ongoing and additional review. Evidence
of $\mu$gravity-induced physiological acclimation is known. Evaluations on
crews in space analogue environments, space flight and \gls{ISS} flights are
ongoing yet the long term effects yet to be fully known and mitigated. Medical
risks variable and the delivery of medical interventions, preventions and care
needs to be refined.  The effects of microgravity and radiation are the most
problematic to human exploration in space. For instance, reliable and suitable
materials technology, design and mitigation for radiation are needed.
Acceptable radiation exposure limits need to be established. Alert/warning and
communications infrastructure from pre-screening, to initial construction
through to settlement phases need to be formalized to analyze the long-term
health risks. Microgravity (from muscle atrophy, vestibular and ocular
disturbance, venous pooling to sleep disturbance and sanitation issues) have
been evidenced and greatly impact crew performance, health and well being, thus
impacting on the entire mission.

Other problems include \begin{enumerate} \item Bone demineralization leading to space-related osteoporosis and vitamin loss \item Temperature extremes \item Circadian dysynchrony and sleep disturbance \item High vacuum (decompression illness) \item Space debris \item Ionospheric plasma and \item Acoustic noise \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Countermeasure}

	\label{acc-counter}
\end{figure}

One strategy for mitigating risks, stressors and ensuring supports for crews in
space is through the development of countermeasures in addition to careful
consideration of crew selection, appropriate training, extreme habitat design,
human factors, social governance supports and societal infrastructures for long
duration spaceflight. (See for instance \autoref{acc-counter}.) Future human
exploration leading to ``staying there'' (\autoref{staying-there}) will need to
design protocols and policies for consent and justice for one-way missions and
strategies for permanent colonisation with ethical micro and meso-social
structures.

Today astronaut crews actively contribute and refine existing technologies and
protocols to ensure best practices and environments for living and working
based on their first-hand experience during space flight or mission; however
the prevalent thought and practice today is essentially terrestrial.
Countermeasures by their very nature, seek to provide supports consistent with
the human need on Earth and thus have an inherent pedestrian and
gravity-centric logic. Mitigating the optical disturbance of zero-gravity for
instance by creating a false orientation with `Up' signs and consistently
angled writing provides crews with short-term adaptation solutions. The need
for Lunar, Martian and general Astro-centric specific counter-measures and
harness-measures will be required in the future if we are to ensure optimum
performance and evolve as an adaptive and empowered space-faring and future
space-dwelling species.

\subsubsection*{Psychological wellness}

The psychological and related physical impacts of long duration space flight
and extended human exploration into space on human performance, social
interactions, group and community interactions, space-Earth relationships and
crew-specific behaviours are critical to operations and overall mission
success. Further research on the sources and impact of long duration space
flight on crew health and incremental risk identification is needed in order to
reclassify behavioural health risks and thus best-plan for eventual human
colonisation of space. The need for autonomous medical care, self-care, remote
care and communications strategies should be considered essential design
requirements for Human Factors and Extreme Design architecture, Crew selection,
pre-flight training, In-flight Procedure, and space-protocols.  

\subsection{Robotic Exploration}
\label{ps-robotic-exploration}
%(to be written by Jan)

By default, much of space exploration today is highly dependent on robotic
systems as well as on support by means of artificial intelligence. From the
early days of space exploration on, humans sent robotic devices and satellites
into space to sense, image and explore the space frontier. However, much of the
robotic exploration systems provide only crude degrees of ``intelligence.''
More often than not, systems in space lag 15 years or more behind technology
available on earth, which is mostly due to safety requirements as well as
extensive research and development cycles within the space industry.  

Another phenomenon which goes along with this is a fundamental dispute over
human vs. robotic space exploration of space. The underlying logic states that
robots will facilitate the groundwork of exploration for humans to follow. At
this stage, the human dream to explore and possibly colonize space is normally
dominated by the premise to move our life support systems into space and onto
other planets.

However, non-augmented human bodies need an earthlike environment almost to
exact earth specifications. Earthlike atmospheres, which are changed by the
very metabolism of the body being in it, water and hundreds of other needs from
complex nutrients, molecules, to exercise, social and spatial requirements.
Ironically, the body that gives us the primary medium for experiencing our
surroundings is also the single largest barrier to traveling and experiencing
space. 

A long-term plan to visit space in human bodies is basically committing to the
idea of bottling up earth and exploring space inside of an ``earth-bottle,''
which entirely separates us from the extraordinary experiences the
interplanetary universe offers us. 

We argue that a new conceptual model to evolve space exploration should be
based on the development of a new kind of humanoid robotics, super-human
artificial intelligence as well as virtual representation of space exploration.
In addition, the development of an inter/intrastellar smart network to connect
all information-based agents, robots, vehicles, nodes and life-support systems
is suggested to provide a collective intelligence approach within space.

Humanoid robots---robots with human-like bodies such as Asimo or
Robonaut---will quickly increase in their sensory capacity, eventually
exceeding perception capabilities of the human body. In limited ways we already
see today how robots equipped with night vision capability, thermal imaging
capability, radar, seismographs, EMI receivers, and so forth augment human
sensing. However, we suggest that such humanoid robots are only the very
beginning of this ``body'' evolution. As described later, exponential advances
in neuroscience, nanotechnology and synthetic biology will allow for a
super-human kind of robots, with many human-like characteristics. However, such
robots can be augmented with sensing and actuation capabilities beyond human
limitations and can be specifically customized for conditions in space. In
addition, the development of a specific ``super-human intelligence'' for such
robots provides significantly higher information processing, problem solving
capabilities, as well as communication characteristics with other intelligences
such as robots, networks, satellites and humans by means of a space-wide
operating system (e.g. ETIR idea ``Intelligent Space Operating System''). Human
intellect can then be uploaded remotely, augmented by means of enhanced
perception/sensing, and experienced individually as well as collectively. Super
Human Intelligent robots for space exploration provide the benefit to be
resistant to adverse conditions within space such as extreme temperatures,
radiation and toxins. By default, they don't require oxygen, food, sleep, or
sunlight and can be designed to be of higher emotional/psychological robustness
compared to humans. Psychological, social and bodily characteristics can be
dynamically shaped to be optimal for individual space missions and can be
adapted over time.  This new kind of robotic super-human space exploration is
meant to open up channels of exploration and experience with a currently
unimaginable level of perceptive richness and extended realism by means of
augmented sensing.  In addition, new kinds of virtual environments,
brain-machine interfaces and multimodal feedback systems will allow us to
navigate such experience at in virtual fashion at increasingly higher
resolution and vividness. This can be shared by everyone on earth rather than
by a few astronauts.  We believe the future of mankind in space can, and will
be more interesting, exciting, and inspiring than the current vision of
exploration with a human earth-bound body -- both can and should happen in a
parallel initially. We believe we can explore the planets not just from the
confines of a space suit or tin can on the surface, but from a spectrum of
physical embodiments, beginning decades ago with space robots that sent back
images for us to experience.  We will then know exactly on earth what it feels
like to stick a feet in the sand of Mars, to go for a space-walk, or to observe
our planet as a swarm of satellites.

\subsection{Space Resources}
\label{ps-space-resources}
%(to be written by Mike)
Human resource consumption increases as the population of the Earth
increases and as each member of the population uses more resources,
but the amount of resources available on the Earth remains fixed.
Fortunately, we as a species are not limited to gathering these resources
terrestrially. While we are facing a shortage of both raw materials\cite{gordon}
and energy\cite{Seboldt2004} here on the planet, both of these resrouces are bountiful
in our solar system and beyond.

This observation is by no means novel. Right now, though, at the dawn
of this new decade, we find ourselves sitting on the brink of an inflection
point with respect to the harvesting of space-based resources and
bringing them back to Earth. For the first time, as a result of the
convergence of several pivotal and game-changing exponentially accelerating
technologies, it will not only be economically viable to supply and
power Earth from space, it will be a necessity.

\subsubsection*{Terrestrial Shortage of Valuable Materials}

There are currently not enough raw materials present on planet Earth
for the world's current population to live with the quality of life
of the modern developed world\cite{gordon}. This shortage clearly
poses a large problem for the sustained growth of humanity in the
upcoming decades, for not only is it desirable for every human being
to have access to the same level of technology as those living in
the developed world, but those in the developed world strive to advance
their technological. Among others, some of the most important of these
scarce materials are platinum group metals\cite{gerlach}.

As these scarce materials are mined and extracted from the Earth,
they become more and more scarce, and as they become more scarce the
cost of mining them and extracting them increases. Fortunately, virtually
all of these terrestrially scarce materials are available in space
and can be found in near-earth asteroids. In the past, the cost of
mining these asteroids and returning their materials to the earth
has been prohibitively expensive. However, in the upcoming five to
twenty years, the convergence of a number of exponentially accelerating
technologies will result in the cost of mining these asteroids decreasing
exponentially. With the cost of mining these materials from the earth
increasing with every passing year, and the cost of mining them from
space decreasing every year, there will be a point in the near future
where it is not only economically viable but economically imperative
to mine asteroids and return their contents to Earth\cite{gerlach}.

There are many advantages of mining near-earth objects for resources
over obtaining the resources from Earth, even aside from terrestrial
shortage. First of all, it is likely that a high percentage prospecting
missions will successfuly find highly valuable asteroids, due to already
well-established science for analyzing the composition of asteroidal
bodies from Earth. The high-grade ore found in asteroids will make
processing (extractive metallurgy) quite easy. No negotiations will
be needed with existing landowners. Additionally, there are no environmental
laws to be dealt with, and mining and waste disposal will not have
any potentially destructive effecst on the terrestrial ecosystem.
Asteroid mining systems will be highly scalable, flexible, and reusable\cite{sonter}.

Additionally, even if there were not a terrestrial shortage of materials
like platinum group metals, there is no doubt that if we had more
of them, it would usher in a new era of abundance on our planet. Imagine
the advances in technology and quality of life that could be made
if engineers could always use the ideal material for the job without
having to worry about price or availability.

Finally, the successful mining of asteroids will be essential to the
ultimate expansion of our species into the solar system and beyond.
Launching heavy objects from the ground in to space makes much less
sense than constructing those objects in space from available resources.
These resources are all available in near-Earth bodies.

Thus, the value of mining asteroids for resources is clear. There
are a number of sub-problems that must be solved in order to successfully
accomplish such a mission\cite{gerlach}. Each of these problems can
be solved elegantly with a combination of exponentially advancing
technologies.

\begin{description}
\item[Remotely mining asteroids without the need for humans. ]Advances
in AI and robotics will make this task cheaper and more efficient,
and cheaper as robotics and microprocessors become cheaper.
\item[Data Collection. ]Improved microprocessors, storage technology,
and sensors will drop the price and enable more and better data to
be collected. 
\item[Mass and performance of spacecraft.] New materials such as carbon
nanofibers and advanced composites will enable lighter structures
to be as strong or stronger than steel.
\item[Launch and Propulsion. ]Advances in launch (particularly beam-powered
launch), solar technology, and energy storage will greatly increase
the efficiency while decreasing the cost, dramatically cutting the
costs of an asteroid mining mission.
\item[Design.] Advances in software modeling and design will dramatically
increase the chance of success and decrease the cost of each mission.
\item[Miniaturization. ]The smaller a mining vehicle is, the more
can be launched per payload and the more fault-tolerant the entire
overall mission can be. Many technologies are getting smaller every
year, and this will dramatically affect the industry.
\end{description}

In sum, it is absolutely essential for humans to mine asteroids for
materials, since Earth is running out of resources, it will be essential
for building space-exploration machinery in place, it will usher in
a new era of abundance on Earth, and the cost of mining space-based
materials will soon be cheaper than mining those same materials terrestrially.
By leveraging a key set of exponentially advancing technologies, it
will for the first time be possible very shortly to mine asteroids
effectively, efficiently, and profitably.

\subsubsection*{Space Based Solar Power}
%(written by Jason) NOTE- I will email Carlos and Davidad the reference material.

An underlying motive for all of human expansion has been the quest for energy.
To early humans this meant the search for food, as food was the only form of
energy they could take advantage of. Later on, our species created ways to
harness other forms of energy through mechanical means---water power, wind
power, coal, oil, uranium. These steady developments led to the expansion of
the human race across the oceans to settle on nearly every habitual space on
Earth.

Today, with a global power consumption of 12TW\cite{Seboldt2004}, we are
reaching the end of the energy supplies we have come to use so commonly. It is
expected that by the year 2020, the global power consumption will be nearly
20TW. It is becoming more expensive and more risky to search for fossil fuels
to power our cities, and the combustion of these fuels is becoming highly
damaging to the environment. Over 85\% of the power used today comes from
fossil fuels\cite{Seboldt2004}. It is generally accepted that the time has come
to focus on powering our world from completely renewable resources, and there
are many resources that can be harnessed; tidal currents, wind, geothermal, and
of course solar. Solar power is unquestionably the ultimate solution to our
energy demands. In fact we have always relied on solar energy, we are just
prefer to use it in it's stored form of a battery called fossil fuels.

When we begin to explore the possibility of harvesting energy in space, rather
than terrestrially, we will create a world of energy beyond what we can imagine
today. The amount of energy in space is far greater than that needed to sustain
the population of the planet for decades to come. For instance, the kinetic
energy in the solar wind is $10^{14}$ MW, or over a million times the current
global power consumption. Collecting solar energy and transporting it to Earth
will not only solve the energy problem, taking everyone out of the ``dark age,''
but will also open the space frontier economically. As soon as the break-even
point is passed, a viable business case for space energy production will
swiftly drive down the costs of launch, as more and more capital comes in from
the energy sector.

\subsection{Space Science}
\label{ps-space-science}
%(to be written by Diva)
\begin{center}
\em ``Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known''
\end{center}
\attrib{\textbf{-- Carl Sagan\index{Sagan, Carl}}}

Before the 19th century, when the term ``scientist'' was first coined, people
investigating Nature called themselves ``Natural Philosophers'' because they
observed the workings of Nature and tried to extrapolate universal rules that
would enable them to understand the surrounding World. What is the unit of
life? What is the unit of matter? Is the Earth flat? These questions put
forward by natural phylosophers, found an answer as technology started making
its first steps into the era of modern science, thus empowering mankind to look
deep into the structure of matter and far out beyond the atmosphere. As
technology kept progressing exponentially, it allowed scientists to wander into
new and unexplored territories. New questions thus arose: does life exist on
other planets? Can intelligent life be found beyond our Solar System? Can there
be different forms of intelligence? How did the Universe form? How did
humankind evolve from prokaryotes? New fields---astrobiology, exobiology,
planetary science, space-based astronomy---were born to answer these questions,
while existing ones---biotechnology, medicine, neuroscience, synthetic biology%
---started just now extending their reach into outer space. Altogether, these
disciplines fall under the umbrella of a new scientific era, that of Space
Science.  

The comparatively nascent field of Space Science is at the cusp of major
growth, given the technologies available in the next decade. The same curiosity
that has driven technology advancement and continuity over the past centuries
on Earth, has lead scientists just beyond the atmosphere over the past decades
and will, in the comparatively near future, bring humanity to explore and
colonize outer space. Space Science will provide a parallel or a whole new
domain of possibilities beyond our imaginations today. Importantly, it will
bring about new paradigms for the Science that is done on Earth, out of the box
thinking that could feed back into the living system with the potential of
tackling many of the still unsolved or unsolvable problems. These underlying
features inevitably set apart Space science from the rest of the modern
sciences. One could say that today is the beginning of a new era in Science, an
era in its own right, which will see its climax in the human colonization of
other Earth-like planets and the exploration of other solar systems. 

\subsection{Space Education/Evangelism}
\label{ps-space-evangelism}
%(written by Jason, edited by davidad)

A key underlying problem to the limit  of humanity's progress in space is that the majority of the human  species is uninterested in space. Activities in space today do not  inspire the awe that they once did: instead of watching astronauts walk  upon the surface of a celestial body for the first time, today, if we're  lucky, we get to watch them repair the toilet on the International  Space Station. Educational outreach is a good start, but we need to  connect humanity to space in a more natural way. Global warming is now  perceived as a threat so compelling that most people believe we need to  do something about it. But this threat is dwarfed by that of remaining  on this planet indefinitely.

NASA's  education program attempts to make space and the STEM (Science  Technology Engineering and Math) curriculum exciting for students, but  they do it without an understanding of the progress exponential  technologies will have on the space industry. Students today rarely  realize that when they grow older they will have a completely different  tool set with which to tackle space. We should teach them what the world  will be like in a decade or two and excite them on the possibilities  they can create.

In  all instances of educating the public on the importance of space, from  youth to the elderly, opening the space frontier is never presented as  an explicit need---which it is. Space is often considered to be  primarily beneficial as an engine for creating technological spin-offs,  but even if space exploration paid no technological dividends, it would  still be crucially important. People don't appreciate the voyage of  Christopher Columbus to the Americas primarily because of the new  sextant developed for the journey that was eventually spun off to the  private sector and used in merchant shipping.

It is human nature that we need to ``see it to believe it,'' and maybe this is what is holding back humanity  from understanding why space exploration is a necessity for survival.  Until ordinary people can experience space through their own eyes, the  possibilities that it holds will not be fully understood. What will  happen when the first child can see our home from space, or when the  first ballet dancer experiences weightlessness, or when a paraplegic is  given mobility again? Let's not just tell humanity about space, let's  give them access to space.



\section{Exponential Technology Areas}
\label{et-overview}
% Summary list\ldotsof what you considered, based on the SU tracks, for example

In this report, we will illustrate a number of opportunities to address the
above problems with exponential technologies. This section serves as a brief
overview to each of the exponential technology areas.

\subsection{AI and Robotics}
\label{et-ai}

% [Can we make this paragraph a vision statement rather than a historical statement?
% Something more from http://su-etherpad.com/tpspace-The-Real-New-Space ?]
%   [davidad: this is intended to be a historical orientation, but feel free to add a
%    third paragraph that is more visionary in tone.]

In the broadest sense, the fields of AI and robotics strive to make non-human systems able to perform human tasks%
%Is this too limiting a view of AI and robotics? -- Will they just be worker tools, or the
%beginnings of a future of extraordinary intelligence and physical capabilities?)
, or other difficult tasks that are helpful to humans. Robotics focuses on the necessary physical capabilities, while AI focuses on the necessary mental capabilities. At present, AI systems are capable of solving a plethora of individual problems, each of them far more swiftly and accurately than a human could; but no robot is capable of loading a dishwasher yet.
% I would not make this point, as Robots already wash our dishes today far better than
% humans do (including total disinfection), and don't do it at all the way we do (contained
% machines). Planes also don't fly like birds, but we might say they are far better for our
% purposes.
This phenomenon is represented by the term ``narrow AI'': each AI system today is typically helpless outside the situation it was designed for. These systems solve problems such as searching the Internet, routing FedEx packages, military logistics, or playing chess. However, it has been predicted that in the future, we wil develop what is known as ``strong AI'': an AI system that nears human levels of tolerating uncertainty, and can generate original solutions to problems hitherto unseen and unanticipated by the designers of the AI.

\subsection{Biotechnology}
\label{et-bio}

We currently live in the Renaissance era of Biology. Molecular biology along
with computer science is the fastest growing science of the past four decades.
This rapid development is due to a consecutive line of major milestones that
include: Solving structure of the DNA, Deciphering the genetic code, Genetic
engineering via restriction enzymes, The PCR machine, Microarry technology, The
completion of the human genome project, microfluidics technology and more. The
vast array of tools and knowledge gave rise to a growing branching of
sub-fields of Molecular Biology that include Genetic engineering, Biophysics,
Protein design, Protein fold prediction, Bioinformatics, Computational biology,
Systems Biology and most recently, Synthetic Biology.
 
In the following paragraphs we shall outline the most notable exponentially
growing molecular biology fields and methods:
 
Genomics is the extension of genetics to the scope of full organisms' genomes.
Genomics is rapidly developing in the reading capabilities of DNA which is
regarded as ``DNA Sequencing,'' the artificial generation of DNA polymers which
is regarded as ``DNA synthesis'' and the comprehension of the genetic
information.
 
DNA Sequencing capability is exponentially improving ever since the human
genome project was launched. The first significant technological leap is owed
to the contribution of Dr. Craig Venters that introduced the ``Shotgun'' method
through his company Celera. An active and highly innovative industry competes
by introducing diverse technologies for sequencing which may be very different
in method. Although there still is no one technological golden standard, the
speed of sequencing and amount of DNA material that can be processed in
parallel is exponentially growing whereas the price is rapidly dropping. This
could be exemplified by the amount of DNA sequences submitted to Genbank, a NIH
funded DNA repository (see figure).

The vast amount of genetically available material paved the way for the
Bioinformatics fields that was essential for the assembly, interpretation and
pattern recognition of the accumulated data. Bioinformatics in turn grow
rapidly and branched into several sub fields that specializes in genes (``coding
regions''), regulatory elements (``intergenic regions''), gene expression
analysis, systems biology and computational biology. Systems biology that aims
to achieve the co-functioning comprehension of a large set of genes and
proteins is rapidly growing as can be seen by the amount of grant funds the
field receives (see figure).
 
Upon the completion of the human genome project in 2000 by both by the
international consortium and the Celera private venture the tipping point and
rise of the post-genomic era began. The draft to our genetic software was
accessible to study for the first time in human history, and genes where being
studied in large sets of thousands rather than one at a time.  A similar era is
about to embark soon, as full genome sequencing prices will fall sufficiently
to enable a multi-genome era where humanity will hold a large set a genomes by
different individuals, enabling comparative genomics, the exhaustive comparison
of entire genomes.
 
DNA synthesis capability, albeit lagging behind the DNA sequencing technology,
is also advancing by a verity of methods, and synthetic DNA grows longer and
cheaper rapidly. As in the DNA sequencing arena, Dr. Craig Venters contributed
greatly to this field to and currently holds the record for the largest
sequences of artificially generated DNA.  Long synthesized DNA is driving the
emerging field of synthetic biology that aims to fabricate novel life forms.
The current state of the art is a partial generation of a bacterial organism.
 
Proteomics is the extension of Biochemistry to the scope of full organisms'
proteins.  Proteomics is rapidly developing in the reading capabilities to
solve the 3D structure of proteins by means of X-ray crystallization and NMR
studies as can be seen by the exponentially accumulation of protein structures
in PDB, the protein data bank (see figure). Although the 3D structure of most
proteins is known to be directed by the amino acid sequence of the proteins,
the question of inferring the structure from the sequence which is also known
as ``the protein folding problem'' is still largely unsolved and is on of
Biology's holy grails. However, the computational prediction of the structures
are growing increasingly better due to superior heuristics, vast amount of
biological raw data and extended computation capabilities, and it is widely
believed this challenge will be eventually solved. The ability to comprehend
the correlation of protein structure and function will enable the rational
protein design and will open a virtually limitless space of synthetic proteins
with properties that to date do not exist in nature. A mature protein design
field could correct for most genetic defects along with the transplantation of
genes via Gene therapy methods, create new genes and produce new bio materials
and biological drugs such as hormones and antibodies. To date, protein design
is limited to semi-random in vitro evolution methods, partially driven by
rational thought and by chimerical approaches of modular construction of
proteins based on naturally existing scaffolds.
 
The microarray technology and its subset DNA-chips is yet another disruptive
trend in biology that enables a vast readout of all the expressed genes within
a cell by assessing the presence of mRNA transcripts. This technology, along
with the exponential advances in DNA sequencing, greatly contributed to the
generation of the Bioinformatics field, and to its sub branches, gene
expression regulation and Systems biology. The microarrays that were at first
extremely expensive, unreliable and with a relatively small number of
biomarkers, are now commonly used, as can be seen in the elevated number of
publications that address microarray data, and they are rapidly growing
cheaper, larger and robust. To date there is still no gold standard to the
optimal mathematical correction algorithm for their analysis, and the field of
microarray analysis quite active.
 
Another disruptive and rather new technology is Microfluidics that enables
micro manipulation and experimentation on single cells via liquidous apparatus
with miniature compartments. Microfluidics enables experimentations that have
previously not been feasible.
 
In the near future, we will be readily reading, generating, transplanting,
manipulating and creating genetic and protein material, capability that will
enable us to reshape life forms including humans.
 

\subsection{Nanotechnology and Materials Science}
\label{et-nano}

The first tools that humans used were simple sticks and stones, native ``bulk''
materials from the environment. Certain rocks were chosen for their hardness,
or for their sharpness when cleaved, while certain sticks were used for their
light weight and as tools requiring aspect ratios that are unattainable using
rocks. Later these bulk materials were combined into things that enabled
functions that were more than the sum of the parts, such as stone axes, animal
traps, and wheeled vehicles.

In a similar way, we are barely beginning our technological evolution in space
and are using many bulk materials, for example the planned Mars Curiosity rover
is made mostly of aluminum and uses two-dimensional monolithic computation
elements. The next step, and the goal of nanotechnology and materials science,
is to discover the structural, electronic, thermal, and other physical
properties of nanoscale materials and learn to harness these properties to
create new or improved functionality, both structurally and on the scale of
sensing and computation elements. These properties that may be inferior in bulk
materials or perhaps not even exist on the macro-scale.

\begin{comment}
Nanostructured materials and nanoscale devices will be precisely engineered on
the molecular scale to harness these properties.  Structurally, they may be
stronger, lighter, or more flexible, such as carbon fiber. They may promise
improvements on existing technology, such as graphene as a replacement for
transistors, or heretofore unforseen devices, such as graphene as an atomically
thin vibrating two-dimensional membrane for mass sensing (while other
materials, even thin materials are three-dimensional). In addition, since
biological organisms are a vast assemblage of nanomachines, the line between
artificial nanoengineering and nature may be blurred in many applications.
\end{comment}

The enabling factors for continued improvement and innovation at the nanoscale
reside in both funding new research and in an applications-centered,
business-driven approach. They may reside in a shift from old ways of thinking
and an agility to absorb new technologies as they become available.

\subsection{Networks \& Computing Systems}
\label{et-computing}

The exponential nature of Information Technologies and Networking is a well
established phenomenon. In 1965, Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore noted that the
number of components in integrated circuits had been doubling roughly every two
years since their invention in 1958, and predicted that the doubling trend
would continue for at least another decade. Since then, and more than forty
years later, Moore's ``law'' continues to signal the evolution of processing
speed, memory capacity, hard- disk storage, power consuption, transistor cost,
and many other applicable metrics that seem to lay, roughly, on exponentially
increasing (or decreasing) curves. (See \autoref{moores-law}.)

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Transistor_Count_and_Moore's_Law_-_2008}
\caption{Transistor count and Moore's Law}
\label{moores-law}
\end{figure}

It is remarkable that these exponential trends have survived many technology
changes, and some technological paradigm shifts, without ralenting even through
global crisis or other political and economical turmoils. An industry-wide
belief in the nature of these exponentials has led companies to invest billions
of dollars in the process of finding the next doubling factor before the
competition, and drove many to describe Moore's law as  the ``self-fulfilling
prophecy'' of the electronics industry. However, and even though every few
years new technical bottlenecks seem to suggest that Moore's Law might be
getting to an end, our current understanding of the fundamental limits of
computation shows that there is no fundamental reason why computational density
should not keep increasing at its exponential pace for the forseeable future.

Over the last five decades, the exponential evolution of electronics has
played a fundamental role in many of the scientific and technological
achievements of humanity, and has been a fundamental enabler of global trade,
the increased efficiency of value chains and the onset of what is called the
knowledge economy. The Internet itself, still in its infancy, has
revolutionized the way we do business, collaborate and interact with each
other, and the same technology, in the hands of billions through mobile phones
and its descendants, is predicted to play a fundamental role in integrating the
next four billion people in the base of the pyramid to the global economy and
to a global society. The astronomical increase in our capacity to generate,
store and process information is leading fundamental changes in the way we
think about and do science. Many other scientific disciplines, including, most
notably, biology, are now increasingly becoming information sciences, and the
exponential trends of information technologies spread to these disciplines and
help put them in their own exponential paths. 

We expect these trends to continue and evolve in the short term, and over the
next few decades, to show an increasing paralellization of today's
architectures, increasing interconnectedness, increasing miniaturization, new
human-machine interfaces, new machine-to-machine interfaces, sensor and
actuator networks; embedded computational systems in everyday objects;
distributed, decentralized platforms for data acquisition, storage and
processing; ubiquitous, high-bandwith networks; high-quality augmented/virtual
reality with haptic interfaces; implantable bio-electronics; new computational
paradigms for high-performance, massively parallel computation; new
computational paradigms for energy-efficient and low heat computation.

At the same time, we expect Information Technologies, Computing Systems and
Networks to impregnate, merge-into and drive the convergence of Biotechnology,
Nanotechnology and Neurotechnology, to a new integrated technology realm at the
nano-scale.


\subsection{Neurotechnology and Medicine}
\label{et-neuro}

The human beings through research and technology have begun to understand the
nature and mysteries of the Universe. However, Space is a harsh environment,
and technological advancements in material science, robotics, power generation,
and medical equipment will be required to ensure that astronauts survive
interplanetary journeys and settlements. In addition, operational challenges,
such as the management of life-support systems, food and nutrition, medical
care, and psychosocial health due to long-term confinement, will have an impact
on human health during long-term space missions and more even if we think to
settle and to stay on other planets or regions in our Solar System.
 
Since the human is considered to be a critical system of space flight in the
same way the propulsion, thermal, and power are critical systems to space
flight, the searching of opportunities where accelerating technologies could be
possible solutions in these issues in the coming future, is warranted.
 
Why go into space when we have so many problems here on Earth? It is a
legitimate question as unfortunately not enough people have been made aware of
the vast benefits the space program provides that increase the quality of our
daily lives. Applications on Earth of technology needed for space flight have
produced thousands of ``spinoffs'' that contribute to improving several fields
including medicine, biotechnology, and neurosciences\cite{TheSpacePlace2004}.
One small example is the Hubble Space Telescope technology which was used in
the Charge Coupled Device (CCD) chips for digital imaging breast biopsies. The
resulting device images breast tissue more clearly and efficiently than other
existing technologies. The CCD chips are so advanced that they can detect the
minute differences between a malignant or benign tumor without the need for a
surgical biopsy. With over 500,000 women needing biopsies, this technology saves
time and money for this procedure versus surgical biopsy. 
 
At the same time, accelerating technologies in medicine and neuroscience should
help to solve huge problems in human space exploration and ``staying there,''
including better methods and techniques in the basic and clinical research,
which are the basis for new knowledge and the source for new technologies. 
 
Medicine tools that could help solving grand challenges are immersing in
biotechnology, nanomedicine and nanomaterials, robotic, artificial
intelligence, bio-engineering, and bio-informatics. More specifically, the
broad spectrum of sensors and biotech for prevention, and early diagnosis of
the health problems, new materials for radiation protection, autonomous medical
care (AI, robotics, bioinformatics) for diagnosis and treatment, and tissue
engineering for recovery, are some interesting examples where exponential
technologies should be involved.
 
Neuroscience research helps us to describe and understand how the brain
controls behavior. One of the critical tools is the recording equipment which
helps us to study the neural signals during behavior. While noninvasive neural
signal recording techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are getting more precise and
easier to operate, their costs are also dropping \cite{mri1991}. As these
equipments are more affordable for the public, more neural recordings from
individuals are available to study a wide range of problems. The exponential
increase in hardware and software tools and the available data help the
development of statistical models for different medical applications, such as
personal health diagnostics.
 
Another trend observed is the decrease in computational time for non-invasive
medical diagnosis through computer tomography (CT), MRI and positron emission
tomography (PET) as the computational power exponentially increases through
techniques like parallelization. Meanwhile, for instance, PET detectors are
getting smaller at an even faster rate, offering higher resolution data
\cite{neuroimage2004}.  \autoref{neuro1} shows that improvements in run time
alone are not sufficient to meet the computing demands for future PET scanners.

law'', the observation that single-processor computing power doubles roughly
every 18 months \cite{neuroimage2004}. The lower curve for the ECAT systems
represents 2D complexity, the upper curve represents 3D complexity.}

Significant improvements can be also found in neural prosthetic devices. Using
implanted electrodes to deliver electrical stimulation to the sensory nervous
system, cochlear implants have been well developed for the deaf to hear and
retinal implants are under FDA trials for the blind to see. \autoref{neuro2}
from \cite{Zeng2004} demonstrated the improvement of sentence recognition of
cochlear-implant users with more recent models. Custom motor prosthetics like
robotic arms with high dexterity are developed for patients who lost their
limbs. Paralyzed patients can now interact with the world with brain computer
interface (BCI). The exponential increase in computational power also allows
researchers to simulate large neuronal network and the resulting knowledge
benefits the development of better neural prosthetic devices.

published in peer-reviewed journals. The score in devices developed thereafter

published in peer-reviewed journals. Besides ``single-electrode'' for the

strategies including SPEAK (Spectral PEAK extraction), ACE (Advanced

\subsection{Policy, Law, and Ethics}

We are not in a position to fully analyze the far-reaching consequences of
near-term steps by space agencies and private space entrepreneurs, however we
can set about to establish a  context for critical evaluation of our
motivations and hesitations at the Singularity University during the 2010 GSP.
This is a time to develop a culture of intense questioning and reflexivity,
weighing up the pros and cons of social and education value, economic and
political drivers, scientific benefits, risks, the battle for sovereignty
between nation states; time readiness, and the lessons learnt from past human
endeavors at each stage of mission  planning and undertaking. Particular
attention must be paid to our obligations and restrictions, the differences of
moral standing and the agents behind them; the intrinsic and instrumental
values of global peoples and the core truths of our calling, in order to plan
effectively and to garner new insights and knowledge for wider reaching
solutions to terrestrial concerns so that we can leverage exponentially
advancing technologies for the benefit of humanity, the planet and the future
of our activities in space. We have a responsibility to boldly stay to serve
legitimate interests as a peaceful, well-meaning people and the opportunity to
explore new ways of seeing life, and space, from a whole new perspective. 

It is posited that if we are to actually improve standards of living on Earth
through space by  generating economic opportunity; providing access to new
resources (material, intellectual and so on) then we need to bring about the
prospect of rapid technological development, the cross-fertilization of ideas,
new visions and shared dreams for the benefit of all human-kind and this begins
with the power of the questions we ask ourselves, and the declarations we make
for our future generations.

\section{Exponential Technology Opportunities}

\begin{comment}
\subsection{Classification of opportunities}

We offer a brief taxonomy of the problems that exponential technologies need to
help overcome during the next three decades in order to facilitate the
exploration and colonization of space. For each area in this taxonomy, we
explore the role that each exponential technology might play.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item AI and Robotics \item   Biotechnology \item  Nanotechnology and Material Sciences \item  Information Technology and Networking \item  Neurotechnology and Medicine \item  Policy, Law and Ethics \item Entrepreneurship 
\end{enumerate}

The goal of these definitions is twofold: to map for future reference
our current understanding of the relative role of each of the
exponential technologies and solution domains, and to help us focus our
in-depth analysis of conceptual solutions to those areas that appear
more fruitful.
\end{comment}

In this section we discuss a number of opportunities we have collectively
identified in the intersection of the exponential technologies described in
\autoref{et-overview} with the problem spaces discussed in
\autoref{problem-spaces}. We have organized these opportunities on a rough
timeline of when the underlying technology trends may enable them. For each
opportunity, we briefly describe the exact {\bf Application}, the {\bf Problem}
being solved, the {\bf Opportunity} to solve it, and with which {\bf
Exponential Technologies}, the {\bf Problem Spaces} it addresses, {\bf Other
Connected Ideas}, an {\bf Estimate of the Potential Benefit}, a list of {\bf
Who is Doing It Now}, the approximate {\bf Time Scale}, {\bf Convergences} with
other ideas, and the most {\bf Significant Bottlenecks}.

\begin{comment}
$\ldots$For each of the sections below, we discuss the current state of the art,
related exponential technologies, potential benefits, convergences with other
technologies, and potential barriers to adoption.

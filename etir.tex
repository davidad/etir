Humanity is presently a one-planet species. Although we have sent
humans into space, and even to the moon, they have only visited and
then returned home to Earth. There are two ways in which this
fundamentally limits us: First, it limits the resources available to
us, in terms of both matter and energy. Second, it makes us vulnerable
to total destruction as a species, should a catastrophe of planetary
scale occur.

This report focuses on applications of exponential technologies that may
facilitate the eventual establishment of a permanent human presence in space.
These steps include the development of technologies to reduce the barriers to
entry into space, technologies that may be needed to remain in space
indefinitely (while also being useful on Earth), practical strategies to use
resources which are off Earth, transformative changes in the business of space
science and exploration, and means to educate, excite, and inspire the general
public about the possibilities and importance of human space exploration.

\section{State of the Problem Space}

\subsection{Overview}
% Short description of the entire Problem Space

Doing business in space should be easy, but it isn't. It's hard to get into
space, even sending robots rather than humans. It's hard to stay in space for
very long--again, even if you send robots.  It's hard to make use of the
resources available in space. And it's hard to convince many people that going
to space is even a good idea.

\subsection{Aspects}
%Detailed description of aspects of the problem space

We have chosen to focus on the following aspects of the problem space:

\input{problem-spaces}

\subsection{Exponential Technology Areas}
% Summary list\ldotsof what you considered, based on the SU tracks, for example

In this report, we will illustrate a number of opportunities to address the
above problems with exponential technologies. This section serves as a brief
overview to each of the exponential technology areas.

\input{et-overview}

\subsection{Classification of opportunities}

We offer a brief taxonomy of the problems that exponential technologies need to
help overcome during the next three decades in order to facilitate the
exploration and colonization of space. For each area in this taxonomy, we
explore the role that each exponential technology might play.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item AI and Robotics \item   Biotechnology \item  Nanotechnology and Material Sciences \item  Information Technology and Networking \item  Neurotechnology and Medicine \item  Policy, Law and Ethics \item Entrepreneurship 
\end{enumerate}

The goal of these definitions is twofold: to map for future reference
our current understanding of the relative role of each of the
exponential technologies and solution domains, and to help us focus our
in-depth analysis of conceptual solutions to those areas that appear
more fruitful.


\section{Exponential Technology Opportunities}

$\ldots$For each of the sections below, we discuss the current state of the art,
related exponential technologies, potential benefits, convergences with other
technologies, and potential barriers to adoption.
